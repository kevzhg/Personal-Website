#### Intro
I am a Electrical and Computer Engineering student with a passion for technology. I believe my curricular and extracurricular knowledge in the realm of software development and past experience at various co-op placements makes a perfect combination for what you are looking for in a candidate. 
<br><br>
I am an extremely self-motivated individual with a drive to succeed. Through past coop experiences, I've gained valuable teamwork and communication skills that are of great importance to a corporate workforce. 
<br><br>

Of course, soft skills don't mean anything without the hard skills. Beginning my voyage into the world of Programming before high school, I have had ample time to get a head start into designing, developing and testing. Throughout my high school and college years, I've been involved in many programming contest and clubs which designs and builds Java and C++ based projects with complex requirements. These involvements are a result of an intense passion for software designing and developing.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
